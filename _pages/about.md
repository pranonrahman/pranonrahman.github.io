I am Raian Rahman, currently working as a **Software Engineer at [Therap BD Ltd](https://therapbd.com/)**, where I focus on full-stack development, system optimization, and data integration. I completed my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering** from the [Islamic University of Technology(IUT)](https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/) , where my research experience have primarily revolved around Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Data Science.

During my time at Therap BD Ltd, I have played a key role in developing the [Therap Connect](https://www.therapconnect.net/) application, working on **Reusable UI Components ,Backend Services, RESTful APIs, and integrating IoT devices** to enhance the application's scalability and robustness. My contributions have also included **optimizing database queries**, which resulted in a significant reduction in execution time and improved system performance. Previously, as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Pioneer Alpha Limited](https://pioneeralpha.com/), I worked on fine-tuning state-of-the-art NLP models like mT5 and mBART for Bengali question-answering systems.

My research work has focused on areas such as **Chart Summarization, Object Detection, Multimodal Learning, Large Language Models, and Text Style Transfer** with notable contributions to NLP and Computer Vision. You can find more about my research and its impact on my Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MiTS-lwAAAAJ&hl=en).
