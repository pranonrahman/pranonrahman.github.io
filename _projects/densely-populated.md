**Summary:**

Worked on object localization and detection for densely-populated traffic scenarios using YOLOv5 with non-maximum suppression ensembling.

**Key Contributions:**

- Worked on object localization and detection for densely-populated traffic scenarios.
- Implemented a solution with non-maximum suppression ensembling to handle complex traffic environments.
